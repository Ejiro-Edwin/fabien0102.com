Active participation in the Gatsby community : development, code review, tests and support.

When I decided to build this website, I knew I wanted to:
- code in React
- not have to deal with a server
- be SEO-friendly (this is where it got hard) 

With these requirements in mind, I searched for the best solution, and this is how I discovered Gatsby (as a pre-alpha version) and I decided to take part! 

My main interventions were:
- enabling Gatsby to run on Windows
- enabling the use of TypeScript
- finding and correcting bugs
- collaborating with other developers on Discord
- Participating in technical choices (including the file architecture)
- reviewing and validating pull requests

After all this, I was finally able to start building my own website using the perfect tools.
