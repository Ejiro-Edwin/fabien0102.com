## Télécom EM - Specializing in Engineering Information Systems

Studying management?! Indeed, during my studies I chose to dive deeper into business subjects differing from my passion: programming.

As a matter of fact, I've been developing since I was 11 years old, and I've always been self-educated. Having a desire to learn, I decided to pursue studies in the management/commerce fields. However, I chose a business school sharing a campus with an IT college, and I chose a specialty that is common to both schools: Engineering Information Systems.

I do not regret this choice, which allows me to apprehend projects with a greater open-mindedness. :)

During that period, I also took intensely part in the club life of the campus: I became vice-president of the Arts Office, President of the makers' club and member of the robotics club.
