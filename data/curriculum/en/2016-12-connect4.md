Christmas holidays \o/ React and Redux are getting increasdingly popular, but I've only used Angular until now...

Not to worry! I used these holidays to fill the gap. I decide to try my hand at implementing a "Connect 4" game, using TDD (I like testing) and in TypeScript.

Thus began my React/Redux adventure! It was in fact this project that I later used as a starter and training material for my work with Actronika.

Verdict : Redux is great! I perfectly understand its popularity. And I can no longer do without the hot-reload ^^ All in all, I have a crush on this stack!
