Development of the software for the Tactronik chip's demonstration kits.

This software, developed with Electron/React/Redux/Redux-observable/Jest, enables the configuration of different predefined haptic effects before sending them to the demonstration chip via the serial port. 

The challenge was to have a layer of serial communication without having access to the chip to do testing before delivery.

Using Redux-observable and a battery of unit tests, the connection succeeded without a hitch. The project can now be easily maintained and evolved. Isn't that great?
