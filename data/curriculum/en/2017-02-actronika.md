Development of a solution to generate haptic effects.

This was a quick project for a client's POC, the aim was to create an application to generate and sequence haptic effects, then export the result. 

The biggest challenges were the speed of the project and the necessity to handle a great volume of data. Therefore, we decided to use a 100% web solution with a CSV export, in spite of the risk of browser latency.

In the end, the product works and the client's requirements were fulfilled!

I also used this first mission for Actronika as an opportunity to train the team in React/Redux/TypeScript/Jest, so as to allow an easy hand-over.
