Conception and development of the entire **Speekoo** application

**Speekoo** is a language learning application. Its advantage lies in its method, based on the language's structure instead of learning by heart responses for specific scenarios.

My responsibilities and projects included:
- The web application using angular 2.
- The mobile iOS and Android applications, using ionic 2 to share code with the web application.
- The general architecture, including the firebase database.
- A standard administration interface to enable importing lessons from an excel file and modify the online content in real time.
- Implementation of the project organisation (Team services, Kanban).
